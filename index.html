    <h1><i>Round & Round with Vinyl Records.</i></h1>
    <h3>A Quick Spin Through the World of Records.</h3>
    <p>A vinyl record is a wax disc with set musical 
        information found in playable grooves on the records surface.
        A needle is dropped on the vinyl record that reads the grooves
         on the disc and plays the information back
        as sound or music. You may be asking yourself, why buy a 
        vinyl record? Why not just listen to music digitally?
        Although, digitial music does give a great sound. 
        Vinyl records offer a much richer, fuller sound 
        closer to that of an artist in concert. Some live records are
         recorded so well and mixed so craftfully that it sounds 
        like the artist is performing in your very own living room.
